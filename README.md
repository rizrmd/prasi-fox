# Prasi Fox

Prasi Fox is an opinionated framework that uses YAML for model configuration, making it easy to define and manage your data models.

## Core Features

### Model Configuration

The heart of Prasi Fox is its YAML-based model configuration system. This approach allows you to:

- Define database tables and relationships in a clear, readable format
- Automatically generate APIs based on your model definitions
- Maintain consistency across your application's data layer

### Authentication System

Prasi Fox includes a robust authentication system that supports:

- User login/logout
- Registration
- Password reset
- Role-based access control

## Getting Started

1. Define your models in YAML configuration files
2. Set up authentication in `shared/config/auth.yaml`
3. Create API endpoints using the `defineAPI` function
4. Use the translation system for internationalized messages
